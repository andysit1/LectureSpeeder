# Lecture Speeder

This script was created to increase my productivity when working with lectures. It converts audio from a video into a transcript using OpenAI Whisper and then queries the data from OpenAI Text Completion in a textbook format. I would like to improve the way that I query the data in the future, as I have found that it is challenging to get good responses due to the API returning incomplete or poor responses. One potential solution could be to fine-tune the model to handle large datasets or develop a method for cleaning the text to create an optimal prompt.
